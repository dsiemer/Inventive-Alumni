           p.summary I decided to shift careers into the area of web development because I wanted a job that challenge me intellectually, but gave me room to grow as an individual. What I have learned to appreciated the most is my ability develop skills in a diverse set of programming languages, something I could hardly imagine doing before GA.

                    p  I have fond memories of this film because I watched it with my father and grandfather when I was younger. The musical scores by Ennio Morricone are all memorable and transcend the film itself in may ways. As I watched it over the years I have come to appreciate more of the details that makes the film great, and I realized the work it takes to make something that stands the test of time.

                      p I always had an eye for web designing and development while working as a QA Engineer/Software Tester, so I decided to join GA WDI bootcamp. The fast paced learning environment made me active and I realized how much I can do in a short span of time. All my projects were completed in less than 3 days and I enjoyed all of it.

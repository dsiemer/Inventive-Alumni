           p.summary I decided to shift careers into the area of web development because I wanted a job that challenge me intellectually, but gave me room to grow as an individual. What I have learned to appreciated the most is my ability develop skills in a diverse set of programming languages, something I could hardly imagine doing before GA.

                    p I always had an eye for web designing and development while working as a QA Engineer/Software Tester, so I decided to join GA WDI bootcamp. The fast paced learning environment made me active and I realized how much I can do in a short span of time. All my projects were completed in less than 3 days and I enjoyed all of it.
